Repository for doing the cropping of cones within the driverless team inside Formula Student @ KTH :

	TO DO:
		* Running the algorithm with several reference images instead of only 1.													            
		* Crop several reference images.																                               
		* Run the script over a set of test images to get sucess of the cone detection.	
		* Implement a script to auto-remove noise (if equal to noise reference then remove)		

 	RESULTS:
		- Energy approach is 3x times faster than bit-by-bit, but not secure it yields better results.
